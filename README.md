## üöÄ **Usage & Examples**

### üîπ Binary Code to Genetic Code:
```python
import bingenetic

# Convert binary to DNA sequence
genetic_code = bingenetic.btg(["00011011"], "dna")  # Binary -> DNA
print(genetic_code)  # Output: 'ACGT'
```

### üîπ Genetic Code to Binary Code:
```python
import bingenetic

# Convert DNA sequence to binary
binary_code = bingenetic.gtb(["ACGT"], "dna")  # DNA -> Binary
print(binary_code)  # Output: '00011011'
```
